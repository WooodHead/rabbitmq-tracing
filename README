An opinionated tracing plugin for RabbitMQ management. Build it like
any other plugin. After installation you should see a "Tracing" tab in
the management UI. Hopefully use is obvious.

Configuration
=============

There is one configuration option, "directory". This controls where
the log files go. It defaults to "/tmp/rabbitmq-tracing".

Performance
===========

On my workstation, rabbitmq-tracing can write about 2000 msg/s to a
log file. You should be careful using rabbitmq-tracing if you think
you're going to capture more messages than this. Of course, any
messages that can't be logged are queued.

The code to serve up the log files over HTTP is pretty dumb, it loads
the whole log into memeory. If you have large log files you may wish
to transfer them off the server in some other way.
